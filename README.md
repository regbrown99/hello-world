# hello-world

I'm opening my first GitHub account.
I just started my journey to Python coding about 3 weeks ago, and I've already learned the importance of version control!!

I was doing it by adding "v2" to the end of my filenames. lol
I was also emailing my scripts between my various computers!
Ha!

Anyway, now I'm using better tools....
